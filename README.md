# FitTrack – AI-Powered Personal Fit 6

Description
---
FitTrack – AI-Powered Personal Fit 6 is a comprehensive web and mobile platform that leverages artificial intelligence to craft tailored workout and nutrition plans. It adapts to user goals, preferences, and real-time health data, providing personalized guidance for healthier living.

## Tech Stack
- PyTorch
- FastAPI
- ASP.NET Core

## Requirements
- PyTorch for AI/ML model processing
- FastAPI for backend API development
- ASP.NET Core for backend services

## Installation

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.9+ installed
- .NET SDK installed
- Necessary environment variables:
  - `AI_MODEL_PATH` — path to the pre-trained PyTorch model
  - `DATABASE_URL` — connection string for the database

**Setup Steps:**
1. Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FitTrack-AI-Personal-Fit-6.git
cd FitTrack-AI-Personal-Fit-6

2. Set environment variables:

bash
export AI_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/your/model.pth
export DATABASE_URL=your-database-connection-string

3. Install backend dependencies:

bash
# For the FastAPI backend
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

4. Set up the ASP.NET Core backend following standard .NET setup procedures.

5. (Optional) Set up the mobile app environment as per the mobile framework used.

## Usage

To run the application:
1. Launch the FastAPI server:

bash
uvicorn main:app --reload

2. Run the ASP.NET Core backend using your preferred IDE or command line:

bash
dotnet run --project BackendProject/BackendProject.csproj

3. Access the web platform at `http://localhost:8000` and ensure mobile integration through your mobile app interface.

## Implementation Steps
1. Develop the AI/ML model using PyTorch to generate personalized workout and nutrition plans.
2. Integrate the PyTorch model into the backend with FastAPI for real-time plan generation.
3. Build the ASP.NET Core backend services to handle user authentication, data storage, and API endpoints.
4. Connect frontend interfaces (web and mobile) to the backend APIs.
5. Implement real-time health tracking data intake to adjust plans dynamically.
6. Test end-to-end functionality and optimize performance.

*(Optional)*
## API Endpoints
- `POST /api/plans` — Generate personalized plans based on user data.
- `GET /api/user/{user_id}` — Retrieve user profile and preferences.
- `POST /api/health-data` — Submit real-time health tracking data.

Ensure security best practices are followed for user data privacy.

*Note: Additional setup details may be required based on your deployment environment.*
